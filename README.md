# KYC-blockchain


## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to explore the possibilities of the intergration of blockchain into KYC (Know Your Customer) apart of AML (Anti-Money Laundering). We have used Solidity to create smart contracts to input and update KYC information on the blockchain.

AML refers to the global laws, regulations, and procedures that are inplace to prevent the act of producing income through illegal activities. The issue with the current AML procedures are that they are not able to keep pace with the evolving complexity and volume of financial transactions which becomes a problem for keeping a check on Laundering activities.

KYC is a component of AML; they are the certain details that the business keeps as an end criteria for the identification of customers who are interested in doing business with them. Some predominant issues that are being faced by the current KYC compliances include issues related to corruption, terrorist financing, and illegal tax avoidance.

According to The LexisNexisÂ® Risk Solutions 2019 True Cost of AML Compliance Study for the United States and Canada, the annual AML compliance costs for the United States and Canadian financial institutions totaled $31.5 billion USD

## How Can This Help? 

Utilizing BLockchain as a distributed ledger system has the potential to unlock the advantages of automated processes such as reducing compliance errors. A blockchain-based registry would not only remove the repetitive efforts of implementing KYC checks, but the ledger would also enabled encrypted updates to client accounts to be distributed in near real-time. 

This ledger provides a historical record of all documents shared and compliance activities undertaken for each client. These records would prove useful when regulators request evidence that a bank has acted in accordance with the requirements of compliance banking. This aspect of blockchain technologies is also helpful in identifying entities attempting to create fradulent histories. Within the provisions of data protection regulation, the data within the blockchain could be analysed to identify irregularities - this can directly target criminal activity.
